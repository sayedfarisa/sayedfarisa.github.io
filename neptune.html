       <h1> <b>INFORMATION NEPTUNE</b></h1>
    <p>
        his infographic features an image of Neptune along with a series of facts that highlight some of the differences between Neptune and Earth.

        A graphic shows that Neptune and Earth orbit the Sun in the same direction.
        The distance from Earth to Neptune ranges from 4.32 to 4.71 billion kilometres depending on their orbits.
        Neptune is 4 times the size of Earth.
        Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth.
        It takes Neptune 165 Earth years to make one revolution around the Sun.
        It takes Neptune 16 hours in Earth time to complete one rotation on its axis.
        The average temperature on Neptune's “surface” is -201 degrees Celsius. The surface is defined as the layer of its atmosphere where the pressure is the same as it is on Earth's surface.
        Neptune is an ice giant and densest of the giant planets. Its atmosphere is hydrogen and helium with a little methane. Beneath the atmosphere Neptune has a mix of slushy water, methane and ammonia around a rocky core.
        Neptune is the windiest planet with clouds of frozen methane that travel at speeds up to 2,000 kilometres per hour, which is three times stronger than Jupiter's winds.
        Neptune has 14 moons. The largest moon, Triton, orbits retrograde in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation.
        Neptune is the only planet in our solar system discovered using math. Its position was predicted using disruptions observed in Uranus's orbit
