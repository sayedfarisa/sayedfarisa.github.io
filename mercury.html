               <p>
                This infographic features an image of Mercury along with a series of facts that highlight some of the differences between Mercury and Earth.

                A graphic shows that Mercury and Earth orbit the Sun in the same direction.
                The distance from the Earth to Mercury ranges from 77 to 222 million kilometres depending on its orbit.
                Mercury is two-fifths the size of Earth.
                Mercury is 1/20 the mass of Earth.
                It takes Mercury 88 Earth days to make one revolution around the Sun.
                It takes Mercury 59 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis.
                Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It is only about 40% larger than Earth's Moon.
                From Mercury, the Sun can appear more than three times larger than it does on Earth.
                The average temperature of Mercury is 178 degrees Celsius. Temperatures can reach 430 degrees Celsius during the day and drop to -180 degrees Celsius at night.
                Mercury has no moons. Of all the planets in our solar system, only Mercury and Venus have no moons.
