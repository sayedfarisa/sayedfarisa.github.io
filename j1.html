       <h1> <b>INFORMATION JUPITER</b></h1>
               <p>This infographic features an image of Jupiter along with a series of facts that highlight some of the differences between Jupiter and Earth.

                A graphic shows that Jupiter and Earth orbit the Sun in the same direction.
                The distance from the Earth to Jupiter ranges from 588 to 928 million kilometres depending on their orbits.
                Jupiter is 11 times the size of Earth.
                Jupiter is 318 times the mass of Earth.
                It takes Jupiter 12 Earth years to make one revolution around the Sun.
                It takes Jupiter 9 hours, 56 minutes in Earth time to complete one rotation on its axis.
                About the same size as Earth, Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a giant, spinning storm that may have been raging since before astronomers discovered the planet 350 years ago.
                The average temperature on Jupiter's "surface" is -145 degrees Celsius. The surface is defined as the layer of its atmosphere where the pressure is the same as it is on Earth's surface.
                Jupiter is a gas giant. Made up of about 86% hydrogen and 14% helium, Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. Its volume is about 1.5 times greater than that of all the other planets in the solar system combined.
                Jupiter has 79 moons. Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, is also the biggest moon in the solar system. It has a diameter greater than that of Mercury.
