A graphic shows that Saturn and Earth orbit the Sun in the same direction.
The distance from the Earth to Saturn ranges from 1.2 to 1.7 billion kilometres depending on where they are in their orbits.
Saturn is 9 times the size of Earth.
Saturn is 95 times the mass of Earth.
It takes Saturn 29 Earth years to make one revolution around the Sun.
It takes Saturn 10 hours, 42 minutes in Earth time to complete one rotation on its axis.
Saturn's rings are made mostly of water ice and a small amount of rocky debris.
The average temperature on Saturn's "surface" is -178 degrees Celsius. The surface is defined as the layer of its atmosphere where the pressure is the same as it is on Earth's surface.
Saturn is a gas giant. Made up of about 94% hydrogen and 6% helium, Saturn is the second largest planet in our solar system. Over 750 Earths could fit inside the giant planet.
