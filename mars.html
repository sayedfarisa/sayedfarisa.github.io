                    A graphic shows Marss and Earths orbits around the Sun.Because Mars orbit is different from Earth, there is one launch window every 26 months.The distance from Mars to Earth is between 55.7 and 401 million kilometres, depending on its orbit.
            Using current technology, it would take over two years for a team of astronauts to travel to Mars and back.
            Mars is half the size of Earth.
            
            Mars is one tenth the mass of Earth.
            There are 687 Earth days in a year on Mars; that how many days it takes for Mars to make one revolution around the Sun.
            There are 365 days in a year on Earth; that how many days it takes for Earth to make one revolution around the Sun.
            The length of a Martian day, known as a sol is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds.
            The average temperature on Mars is minus 55 degrees Celsius. When the sun is shining in the summer, the temperature near the Martian equator can reach 20 degrees Celsius, but it drops to minus 100 degrees Celsius at night!
            The highest wind speed recorded on Mars is 144 km/h.
            Water has been found on Mars in the form of vapour, ice and snow.
            The height of Olympus Mons, the highest known mountain in the solar system, is 26 kilometres, over three times the height of Mount Everest.
            Mars is very cold. The average temperature on Mars is minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit — way below freezing!

Its surface is rocky, with canyons, volcanoes, dry lake beds and craters all over it. Red dust covers most of its surface. Mars has clouds and wind just like Earth. Sometimes the wind blows the red dust into a dust storm. Tiny dust storms can look like tornados, and large ones can be seen from Earth. Mars’ large storms sometimes cover the entire planet.
Mars has about one-third the gravity of Earth. A rock dropped on Mars would fall more slowly than a rock falls on Earth. A person who weighs 100 pounds on Earth would only weigh about 38 pounds on Mars because of the reduced gravity.

The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth’s. The Red Planet’s atmosphere contains more than 95% carbon dioxide and much less than 1% oxygen. People would not be able to breathe the air on Mars.
